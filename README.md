The purpose of the project is to design, implement, and evaluate a virtual reality digital simulated
learning program for the installation and construction process of wooden light frame structures (or WLF).
The system will allow the user to using multiple kinds of virtual tools such as timber studs, panels, and
carpenter tools in the area of a VR simulated experimental construction site to learning the process of
assembly and disassemble a WLF structure with predefined connections. During the simulation, the user
might cycle between each discrete stages or phases of the construction from the start to the end of the
process, which could be useful for both the teaching or training purposes.
